Whirlycache Changes

-------------------------------------------------
Release 0.7.1
-------------------------------------------------
This is mainly a bugfix release.  We've fixed the Store implementation 
so that Cocoon users will have better luck using Cocoon and Whirlycache.  
Thanks to Eric Meyer, Peter Royal, and Gregor Rothfuss for assistance.

Peter Royal also found a bug in remove(), whereby an internal housekeeping 
object was returned instead of the object originally placed in the 
cache.
